# Experiment 2.5: Arbitrary Waveform Generator Driven Transmitter - Addendum

## Introduction

This experiment is an addendum to Experiment 2 where we found that the Rx voltage for when the Tx-Rx distance is 10mm is greater than when it's 5mm. Strangely, more power was transfered at a greater distance. We investigate this behavior in this experiment.

## Methods

This experiment's setup is identical to that of Experiment 2. We found the distances where the votlage across the receiver is at a local maxima and minima for a couple of trials. Starting at the closest distance between the receiver and transmitter where the Rx voltage is at a local maxima, we increase the distance between them until the Rx voltage local minima. Then, we pull it apart further until the Tx voltage is a local maxima again. The distances and Rx voltages are recorded at each one of these instances.

## Results

Below is the Tx-Rx distance and Rx voltage for each data point, along with a scatter plot visualizing the data.
